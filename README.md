Cirql (pronounced Circle) is a simple lightweight ORM and query builder for [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/), providing fully type-safe queries and [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) powered parsing & validation. Unlike most query builders, Cirql's flexible nature leaves you with complete control over your queries, while still providing powerful APIs to query your database in a concise manner.

## Features
- üîó Connect to SurrealDB over stateful WebSockets or stateless HTTP requests
- üì¶ Support for query batching & transactions
- ‚öôÔ∏è Zod-powered schema validation of query results
- üìù Full TypeScript support with Zod schema inference
- üíé Write flexible queries using the Query Writer API
- ‚úÇÔ∏è Support for raw query strings and native Surreal functions
- üî• Works both in browser and backend environments

## Notice
Cirql is still in early developmental stages. While you can use it for production applications, it may still lack specific features and edge cases. Feel free to submit feature requests or pull requests to add additional functionality to Cirql. We do ask you to please read our [Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

While we try to prevent making any significant API changes, we cannot guarantee this.

## Installation
The first step to use Cirql is to install the package from npm, together with a supported version of zod.
```
npm install cirql zod
```

## How to use
You can [read our documentation](https://cirql.starlane.studio/) for information on how to use Cirql.

## Example
The following query fetches up to 5 organisations that are enabled and have the given user as a member. The result is parsed and validated using the provided Zod schema.

```ts
import { RecordSchema, select } from 'cirql';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Define your Zod schemas
const Organisation = RecordSchema.extend({
    name: z.string(),
    isEnabled: z.boolean(),
    createdAt: z.string()
});

// Execute a select query
const organisations = await cirql.execute({
    query: select()
        .from('organisation')
        .with(Organisation) // Specify the schema
        .limit(5)
        .where({
            isEnabled: true,
            members: any(userId)
        })
});
```
